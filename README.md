# Population Bayesian Inference

This project demonstrates the use of **Bayesian inference** and **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** to estimate the degradation of a population of units over time. The focus is on analyzing population-level trends, variability, and uncertainty in key parameters.

## **Features**
- Simulates synthetic population data with configurable priors for degradation rates and initial outputs.
- Implements a hierarchical Bayesian model using [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml).
- Infers both population-level parameters (e.g., mean degradation rate) and unit-specific parameters (e.g., individual rates).
- Visualizes posterior summaries, trace plots, and posterior predictive checks.

### **Results Interpretation**

This project estimates the population-level degradation of units using Bayesian inference. The results include **posterior statistics** and **graphs** that provide insights into the population parameters.

#### **Key Outputs**
1. **Posterior Summaries (Statistics)**:
   - **mu_d**: Represents the **average degradation rate** across the population. A lower value indicates slower degradation, which is desirable.
   - **sigma_d**: Represents the **variability** in degradation rates among individual units. Larger values indicate greater diversity in how units degrade.
   - **mu_y0**: Represents the **average initial output** for the population, indicating starting performance.
   - **sigma_y0**: Represents the **variability** in initial outputs across units.

   **How to Interpret**:
   - Smaller values of `sigma_d` and `sigma_y0` suggest a more homogeneous population (units behave similarly).
   - Larger values indicate a more diverse population, where individual units degrade or start differently.

2. **Graphs**:
   - **Posterior Predictive Check**:
     - This graph shows how well the model's predictions align with observed data over time.
     - A close alignment indicates a good fit between the model and data.
     - Wider spreads in predictions indicate higher uncertainty in the model’s outputs.
   - **Trace Plots**:
     - These visualize how well the MCMC chains converge.
     - Stationary, overlapping chains indicate reliable results, while non-converging chains suggest the need for more iterations or better tuning.

3. **R-hat Diagnostic**:
   - **R-hat** measures the convergence of MCMC chains. Values close to 1 (e.g., <1.1) suggest good convergence.
   - Higher R-hat values indicate potential problems with the sampling process and may require revisiting model tuning.

#### **Example Use Case**:
If the `mu_d` value suggests slower degradation and the `sigma_d` value is small, the population is degrading uniformly and slowly—ideal for long-term reliability. Conversely, higher variability in `sigma_d` may signal the need to monitor specific subgroups of units.
